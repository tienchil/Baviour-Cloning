# Behavioral Cloning Project

This project is the third one in Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree.
The main goal of this project is to collect data from simulator provided by Udacity and use them to train and build a model such that the car will be **autonomous** and stay within the lane.

The model can be found in model.py with explanation in writeup_report.md

The result of this project is in video form, which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHCnI39osbY).
